# AGRIFARM
Organic farmingÂ uses fewer pesticides, reduces soil erosion, decreases nitrate leaching into groundwater and surface water, and recycles animal wastes back into the farm.

Anyone who wants organic foods and want to lead healthier life.There is a growing demand in the western world for organic food .Consumers are prepared to pay significant premium for it 
Organic farming currently accounts for about one percent of agriculture land worldwide.
So I decided to make website for farming Brand AGRIFARM which help  farmers to increase their farming.
