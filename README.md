AGRIFARM
Organic farming uses fewer pesticides, reduces soil erosion, decreases nitrate leaching into groundwater and surface water, and recycles animal wastes back into the farm.

Anyone who wants organic foods and want to lead healthier life.There is a growing demand in the western world for organic food .Consumers are prepared to pay significant premium for it 
Organic farming currently accounts for about one percent of agriculture land worldwide.
So I decided to make website for farmers to help them to increase their farming.

The organic farming website has 4 Navigation bars like Home, Our Product, Organic Farming, About us.
Home: In the home page I added background image and welcome to agrifarm text in the header section
and I added navigation bars to every page 
About us: In the about us section visitors will know about agrifarm and next I added images with hover effect to look beautiful
Our Product : in the product list i added some products and if you want to see more products you can click more button here and next I added footer of the website when you click more button it will redirect to our product page  and you can see neem oil for plants and its price and details, Navadhanya seeds, Garlic oil  spray and several products 

Organic Farming:  In this section I added small details of about us and our team members also you can see agricultural scientist and their details and next you see the details of the organic farming  Soil Management ,Biological control of insects ,crop diversity ,natural pesticides and I added some images to look more beautiful to visitors
