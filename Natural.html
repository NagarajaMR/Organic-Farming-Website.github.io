            <h1>Organic Farming</h1>
          <p>&ldquo;
            Organic products are grown under a system of agriculture without the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides with an environmentally and socially responsible approach. This is a method of farming that works at grass root level preserving the reproductive and regenerative capacity of the soil, good plant nutrition, and sound soil management, produces nutritious food rich in vitality which has resistance to diseases.
            we produced around certified organic products which includes all varieties of food products namely Oil Seeds, fibre, Sugar cane, Cereals & Millets, Cotton, Pulses, Aromatic & Medicinal Plants, Tea, Coffee, Fruits, Spices, Dry Fruits, Vegetables, Processed foods etc. The production is not limited to the edible sector but also produces organic cotton fiber, functional food products etc.&rdquo;

            <h1>Soil Management</h1>
          <p>&ldquo;Managing soil fertility in organic farming systems requires a different approach from that used in conventional farming systems. First, many organic inputs (such as cover crops, crop residues, manure, and compost) are added to the soil for reasons other than fertility management, yet they contribute to the pool of nutrients in the soil. Second, most organic materials, including compost and manure, have only a small component of soluble nutrients; most of their nutrients must be transformed through biological processes before they become available to plants. Lastly, most manures and composts do not have a consistent nutrient content as found on bags of synthetic fertilizers. They also contain a ratio of nutrients different from that needed for optimal plant growth.&rdquo;

            <h1>Biological Control of Insect Pests</h1>
          <p>&ldquo;Biological control is the use of living organisms to suppress pest populations, making them less damaging than they would otherwise be. Natural enemies of insects play an important role in limiting the densities of potential pests. These natural enemies include predators, parasitoids, and pathogens. Biological control of potential pest insects can be increased by: 1) conservation of existing natural enemies, 2) introducing new natural enemies and establishing a permanent population, and 3) mass rearing and periodic release of natural enemies, either on a seasonal basis or inundatively

            <h1>crop diversity</h1>
          <p>&ldquo;Crop diversity has spatial and temporal dimensions. Practices such as mixed cropping or intercropping, and growing diverse crops at landscape scale, characterise agricultural diversity in space. Rotation of crops provides agricultural diversity over time. Increased crop diversity over both space and time is associated with improved soil health, pest control, decreased erosion, and increased nutrient cycling&rdquo;

            <h1> Development of Natural Pesticides</h1>
          <p>&ldquo;Natural pesticides are biodegradable, barely leave residues in the soil and are less likely to harm humans or animals. In addition, they are cheaper and more accessible in less developed countries. Farms provide food for people and increase pest populations.&rdquo;
